== README : MOVECALC

(2/7/14)
This is my first attempt at an original app. It's being developed alongside various tutorial apps as I learn Rails.
The purpose of it is to have a place for me to store the income I receive for each job I do as a mover.



-Features I would like to have:

   -track the date, duration, tip, and total money recieved from each job.
